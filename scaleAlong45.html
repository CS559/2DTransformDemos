                <h1>Non-Uniform Scale along 45 degree axis Example</h1>
                <p>Click the checkbox to run the animation</p>
                <p>Or use the slider to move along the animation</p>
                <p>This example shows how to scale along a 45 degree axius 
                    (since Canvas has angles going clockwise, this is down and two the right).
                    I am stretching the square along this axis - the axis (up and right) is 
                    not stretched.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The code to do this is:
                    <code><pre>
                        context.rotate(Math.PI/4);
                        context.scale(2,1);
                        context.rotate(-Math.PI/4);
                    </pre>
                    </code>
                    But understanding why this works is tricky. This animation should help.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the animation runs, you'll see the transformations act on the coordinate systems.
                    The trick is that in the last transformation, the rotation is happening in a distorted
                    coordinate system (it was stretched), so it doesn't look like a rotation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In class, I drew this in a simplified way - it was too hard to show the rotation in 
                    stretched space. This will hopefully make things clearer. Although, 
                    things involving non-uniform scales are tricky no matter what.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can use "view source" to see the code, but the code of interest is
                    made complicated by the animation infrastructure.
