        <h1>Non-Uniform Scale along 45 degree axis Example</h1>
        <p>Click the checkbox to run the animation</p>
        <p>Or use the slider to move along the animation</p>
        <p>This example shows how to scale along a 45 degree axius 
            (since Canvas has angles going clockwise, this is down and two the right).
            I am stretching the square along this axis - the axis (up and right) is 
            not stretched.
        </p>
        <p>
            The code to do this is:
            <code><pre>
                context.rotate(Math.PI/4);
                context.scale(2,1);
                context.rotate(-Math.PI/4);
            </pre>
            </code>
            But understanding why this works is tricky. This animation should help.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the animation runs, you'll see the transformations act on the coordinate systems.
            The trick is that in the last transformation, the rotation is happening in a distorted
            coordinate system (it was stretched), so it doesn't look like a rotation.
        </p>
        <p>
            In class, I drew this in a simplified way - it was too hard to show the rotation in 
            stretched space. This will hopefully make things clearer. Although, 
            things involving non-uniform scales are tricky no matter what.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can use "view source" to see the code, but the code of interest is
            made complicated by the animation infrastructure.
